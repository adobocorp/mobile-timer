## Project Overview
This is a mobile stopwatch application built with:
- **React** with TypeScript for the frontend
- **Capacitor.js** for mobile cross-platform capabilities

- Ensure mobile-first responsive design
- Follow modern React best practices (hooks, context, etc.)

## Component Structure
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use custom hooks for complex state logic
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props and state

## Mobile Considerations
- Design for touch interfaces
- Ensure proper viewport configuration
- Consider mobile performance optimizations
- Test across different screen sizes
- Use Capacitor plugins appropriately for native features

## Stopwatch App Specific
- Focus on precise timing functionality
- Simple start/stop/reset controls
- Ensure UI is clear and accessible during use
- Consider offline functionality
- Optimize for battery usage
